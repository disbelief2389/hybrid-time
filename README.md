# hybrid-time
all of my attempts at and assets for making a hybrid 1:1 pomodoro inspired stopwatch/timer
this app aims to combine a stopwatch and countdown timer to ensure a perfect 1:1 work-to-rest ratio, with custom audio cues every 30 minutes during work.

## features
- start as a stopwatch, switch to countdown for breaks
- custom audio cues every 30 minutes during work
- balanced 1:1 work-rest ratio enforced
- futuristic sci-fi ai-style voice notifications

## current status
the app is partially functional but struggles with background timer consistency. i’ve attempted builds in kotlin and typescript and others, but all have unresolved issues.

## how to contribute
- clone the repo and explore the code in the respective folders (kotlin, typescript, etc.)
- feel free to pick up any version and improve it
- reach out with questions or submit a pull request
